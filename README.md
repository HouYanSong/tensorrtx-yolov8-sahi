# tensorrtx-yolov8-sahi
This project introduces how to implement the high-performance deployment of `YOLOv8-SAHI` with `Int8 Engine` on embedded devices such as `Jetson`. The time consumption for testing the `image slice` and` batch inference` on `Jetson Orin Nano (8GB)` is only `0.04` seconds, more than `20 fps`.
